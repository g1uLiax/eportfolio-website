                <p>
                    In the TBZ we have module classes on Monday and normal school subjects on Tuesday, 
                    except for those who attend the BMS. At the TBZ a total of 16 different professions are taught. 
                    In our case this is computer science. In the module lessons we are introduced to the basics of Java and we learn how to plan, 
                    document and execute a project. On Tuesday we have typical school subjects. We have English, Math and ABU. 
                    In English we are expanding our vocabulary and also how to write grammatically correct sentences. In math, 
                    it's actually the same as before in public school and in ABU we are currently being educated in the subject of law.

                    Only one of us two goes to the BMS and that is Giulia. The BMS lasts four years. 
                    It is very strict and has more subjects covered than the TBZ. For example, French, physics, history, etc. 
                    The vocational BMS is a degree in Switzerland that can be obtained after secondary school in 
                    four years parallel to a professional apprenticeship or after a professional apprenticeship 
                    in one year of full-time instruction or in two years of part-time instruction. Once you have completed the BMS, 
                    you can go to a University of applied sciences. The BMS Matura contains of exams for every subject. Some also have an oral exam, most others contain of projects or big exams.
