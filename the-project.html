        <p class="prtext">At first we didn't really know what we wanted to do as a project and then we decided to make an e-portfolio about ourselves. 
            We did a lot of research about our project and found some tutorials or codes that we could use. Then we made a lot of sketches for the design. 
            We have also created a task list and a Gantt chart for us as an overview. 
            The communication among each other worked pretty well so that everyone was always informed about the latest state of the project. 
            In case of difficulties we tried to help each other or look for help. We decided to write a profile about ourselves in the content. 
            In the part "our school" we decided to report about the school as we currently perceive it and in the part "The Project" we decided as you 
            can read here how we have been during the whole project work and also how our final product looks like. We have invested a lot of time and our decisions are mostly well thought out. 
            Partly we had to do a few things differently than planned. But our final product is more or less as we imagined it.
